# Data-Analytics-Visualization

This repository contains three projects showcasing my data analytics skills in different domains.

Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports Cars Dataset:
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of sports cars and conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the features that differentiate sports cars from regular cars. I used Python and libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the data and draw meaningful conclusions.

Data Visualization For Diamond Dataset:
In this project, I explored a dataset of diamonds and created visually appealing and informative plots using Python libraries like Seaborn and Plotly. I used data visualization techniques to understand the relationships between the various features of the diamonds and to identify trends in diamond prices.

Computer Vision Application That Detects And Classifies Objects:
In this project, I built a computer vision application using Python and OpenCV that detects and classifies objects in an image. I used a pre-trained model and fine-tuned it on a custom dataset of objects to achieve high accuracy in object detection and classification.

All of these projects demonstrate my proficiency in data analytics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Please feel free to explore the code and provide feedback.
